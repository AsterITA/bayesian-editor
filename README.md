# Bayesian Editor

Author: Fabrizio Musella

Date of Creation: 10/2019

DISCRIPTION: Bayesian Editor for creating Bayesian networks and make inference on them.

BASIC INFO: 
This project is designed for creating a graphical representation of a weighted graph with nodes and edges.  Graph algorithms can also be 
run on the graph and the results of the algorithms are displayed graphically.  

To use the full application run the GraphGuiApplication.py file.  

FILES:
The python files contained in the PythonGraphGui folder contain classes and functions for creating the graphical representation of graph and supporting user interaction with the graph.  

The GUI files utilize an underlying Graph object.  The underlaying graph can then be used with functions from the graph_path_algorithms 
to return results which are then taken and displayed graphically by the GUI objects.
